## 🧠 Business Insights Discovered

1. **Vegetables** are the highest-selling category 🥦  
2. **Fridays** have the most orders, **Mondays** the least  
3. **Revenue dips in February and April** — possible customer churn or campaign gaps  
4. **Repeat customers** contribute only ~40% of total orders — opportunity for loyalty programs  
5. Some **cities consistently outperform others**, ideal for scaling logistics and marketing focus  
6. Discounts impact varies across products — optimization recommended
